DUMMY-UPS(8)
============

NAME
----
dummy-ups - Driver for multi-purpose UPS emulation

NOTE
----
This man page only documents the specific features of the
*dummy-ups* driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program is a multi-purpose UPS emulation tool.
Its behavior depends on the running mode: "dummy" or "repeater".

Dummy Mode
~~~~~~~~~~

In this mode, *dummy-ups* looks like a standard NUT device driver to
linkman:upsd[8] and allows one to change any value for testing purposes.
It is both interactive, controllable through the linkman:upsrw[1] and
linkman:upscmd[1] commands (or equivalent graphical tool), and batchable
through script files. It can be configured, launched and used as any other
"real" NUT driver. This mode is mostly useful for development and testing
purposes.

Repeater Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this mode, *dummy-ups* acts as a NUT client, simply forwarding data.
This can be useful for supervision purposes. This mode can also allow some
load sharing between several `upsd` instances communicating with ultimate
NUT clients, wit a "central" one using a point-to-point communication with
the UPS. This arrangement can also help with networked UPSes, whose network
management cards can be overwhelmed with a farm of servers directly polling
SNMP or other protocols every few seconds.

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

The `port` specification in `ups.conf` depends on the running mode, and allows
the driver to select the right mode of operation.

Dummy Mode
~~~~~~~~~~

In this context, `port` in the `ups.conf` block defines a file name for the
*dummy-ups* to read data from. This can either be an absolute or a relative
path name. In the latter case the NUT sysconfig directory (i.e. `/etc/nut`,
`/usr/local/ups/etc`, ...) is prepended.

For instance:

	[dummy]
		driver = dummy-ups
		port = evolution500.seq
		desc = "dummy-ups in dummy mode"

This file is generally named `something.dev` or `something.seq`. It contains
a list of all valid variables and associated values (you can later use `upsrw`
only to modify values of these variables), and has the same format as an
linkman:upsc[8] dump (`<varname>: <value>`). So you can easily create
definition files from an existing UPS using `upsc > file.dev`.

It can also be empty, in which case only a basic set of data is available:
`device.*`, `driver.*`, `ups.mfr`, `ups.model`, `ups.status` as filled by
the driver itself.

As a special format extension for testing purposes, numeric values can be
followed by a space-separated specification for randomization around the
originally specified base value, as follows:

	variable: INT_OR_FLOAT [~(INT_OR_FLOAT;INT_OR_FLOAT)[%][@PROB[%]]]...
	variable: INT_OR_FLOAT [~INT_OR_FLOAT[%][@PROB[%]]]...

The first format allows to flexibly specify the maximum negative and positive
deviations from the base value, in percentage or absolute units. The second
format is a shortcut to set both deviations to the same value. The probability
suffix is an integer that specifies the chance that this modification will be
at all applied in this particular cycle (0% == disabled, 100% == always).
If not specified, the probability for an item is 100%. Several items of either
format can be present on a line, evaluated in order of appearance and ending
the evaluation for a cycle as soon as any item hits (e.g. the first item with
unspecified or explicit 100% probability always hits). If none of the modifier
specifications won this round, the original base value is used. The resulting
number is truncated to the integer or floating point precision same as the
specified base value. Invalid tokens are logged and ignored, to provide for
possible future compatibility.

For example:

	input.voltage: 220.0 ~5%@10 ~(15;3.3)@30%
	input.frequency: 50.0 ~1%

Here (on average) the voltage might be 220.0V +/- 5% in 10% of the cases,
or from 205.0V to 223.3V in 30% of the other cases, or exactly 220.0V
otherwise. The frequency here always fluctuates up to 1% around 50Hz.

Some sample definition files are available in the `data` directory of the
NUT source tree, and generally in the sysconfig directory of your system
distribution.

Since *dummy-ups* will loop on reading this file, you can dynamically modify
it with some external process to "interact" with the driver. This will avoid
message spam into your system log files, if you are using NUT default
configuration.

You can also use the `TIMER <seconds>` instruction to create scheduled event
sequences (such files are traditionally named with the `.seq` extension).
For example, the following sequence will loop on switching `ups.status`
between "OL", "OB" and "OB LB" every minute:

	ups.status: OL
	TIMER 60
	ups.status: OB
	TIMER 60
	ups.status: LB
	TIMER 60

It is wise to end the script with a `TIMER` keyword. Otherwise *dummy-ups*
will directly go back to the beginning of the file and, in particular, forget
any values you could have just set with `upsrw`.

Note that to avoid CPU overload with an infinite loop, the driver "sleeps"
a bit between file-reading cycles (currently this delay is hardcoded to one
second), independently of (and/or in addition to) any `TIMER` keywords.

Repeater Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this context, `port` in the `ups.conf` block is the name of a remote UPS,
using the NUT format, i.e.:

	<upsname>@<hostname>[:<port>]

For instance:

	[repeater]
		driver = dummy-ups
		port = ups1@remotehost
		desc = "dummy-ups in repeater mode"

Unlike UPS specifications in the rest of NUT, the `@hostname` portion is not
optional - it is the `@` character which enables Repeater Mode. To refer to an
UPS on the same host as *dummy-ups*, use `port = upsname@localhost`.

Note that to avoid CPU overload with an infinite loop, the driver "sleeps" a
bit between data-requesting cycles (currently this delay is hardcoded to one
second), so propagation of data updates available to a remote `upsd` may lag
by this much.

INTERACTION
-----------

Once the driver is loaded in dummy mode, you can change any variables, except
those of the `driver.*` and `server.*` collections.
You can do this by either editing the definition file, or use the
linkman:upsrw[1] and linkman:upscmd[1] commands.

Note that in simulation mode, new variables can be added on the fly, but only
by adding these to the definition file (and waiting for it to be re-read).
Conversely, if you need to remove variable (such as transient ones, like
`ups.alarm`), simply update these by setting an empty value. As a result,
they will get removed from the data.

In repeater mode, the driver acts according to the capabilities of the UPS,
and so supports the same instant commands and settable values.

BACKGROUND
----------

Dummy Mode was originally written in one evening to replace the previous
dummycons testing driver, which was too limited, and required a terminal for
interaction.

*dummy-ups* is useful for NUT client development, and other testing purposes.

It also helps the NUT Quality Assurance effort, by automating some tests on the
NUT framework.

It now offers a repeater mode. This will help in building the Meta UPS approach,
which allows one to build a virtual device, composed of several other devices
(either UPS, PDUs).

BUGS
----
Instant commands are not yet supported in Dummy Mode, and data need name/value
checking enforcement, as well as boundaries or enumeration definition.
