NUT variable names and instant commands

[NOTE]
.RFC 9271 Recording Document
====
This document is defined by RFC 9271 published by IETF at
https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9271 and is referenced as the
document of record for the variable names and the instant commands used
in the protocol described by the RFC.

On behalf of the RFC, this document records the names of variables
describing the abstracted state of an UPS or similar power distribution
device, and the instant commands sent to the UPS using command `INSTCMD`,
as used in commands and messages between the Attachment Daemon (the `upsd`
in case of NUT implementation of the standard) and the clients.
====

This document defines the standard names of NUT commands and variables
(not to be confused with <<_status_data,device status data>> described in
ifdef::website[]
another chapter).
endif::website[]
ifndef::website[]
the `docs/new-drivers.txt` in NUT source codebase).
endif::website[]

Developers should use the names recorded here, with dstate functions and
data mappings provided in NUT drivers for interactions with power devices.

If you need to express a state which cannot be described by any existing
name, please make a request to the NUT developers' mailing list for
definition and assignment of a new name.  Clients using unrecorded names
risk breaking at a future update.  If you wish to experiment with new
concepts before obtaining your requested variable name, you should use
a name of the form `experimental.x.y` for those states.

Put another way: if you make up a name that is not in this list and it
gets into the source code tree, and then the NUT community comes up with
a better name later, clients that already use the undocumented variable
will break when it is eventually changed.  An explicitly "experimental"
data point is less surprising in this regard.

Similarly, some source files (`drivers/*-mib.c` and `drivers/*-hid.c`)
may mention data point names following the pattern of `unmapped.x.y`.
These are generated by helper scripts which walk the reports from SNMP
and USB HID devices, respectively `scripts/subdriver/gen-snmp-subdriver.sh`
and `scripts/subdriver/gen-usbhid-subdriver.sh`, and assign names based on
strings in those reports. The `unmapped` entries should not be exposed in
"production" builds of the NUT drivers. They are an aid for developers to
know that such entries are served by their device, so an existing standard
NUT name can be assigned for the concept (or new name negotiated with the
community), but are normally hidden with `#if WITH_UNMAPPED_DATA_POINTS`
clauses which can be enabled in custom NUT builds by use of
`./configure --with-unmapped-data-points` option.

NOTE: In the descriptions, "opaque" means programs should not attempt to
parse the value for that variable as it may vary greatly from one UPS
(or similar device) to the next.  These strings are best handled directly
by the user.

Structured naming
-----------------

All standard NUT names of variables and commands are structured, with
a certain domain-specific prefix and purpose-specific suffix parts.
NUT tools provide and interpret them as dot-separated strings (although
third-party tools might restructure them by cutting and pasting at the
dot separation location, e.g. to represent as a JSON data tree or as
data model classes for specific programming languages).

If you would be making a parser of this information, please do also note
that in some *but not all* cases there is a defined data point for some
reading or command at the "root level" of what evolved to be a collection
of further structured related information (and there are no guarantees
for future evolution in this regard), for example:

* an `input.voltage` reports the momentary voltage level value and
  there is a `input.voltage.maximum` for a certain related detail;
* conversely, there are several items like `input.transfer.reason`
  but there is no actual `input.transfer` report.

There may be more layers than two (e.g. `input.voltage.low.warning`),
and in certain cases detailed below there may be a variable component
in the practical values (e.g. the `n` in `ambient.n.temperature.alarm`
variable or `outlet.n.load.off` command names).

Time and Date format
--------------------

When possible, dates should be expressed in ISO 8601 and RFC 3339 compatible
Calendar format, that is to say "YYYY-MM-DD", or otherwise a Combined Date
and Time representation (`<date>T<time>`, so "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm").
Separators for the date (hyphen) and time (colon) components are required
to conform to both ISO 8601 "extended" format and RFC 3339 required format.

In the case of Date and Time representation, a timezone can be added as per
RFC 3339 and the newer revisions of the ISO 8601 standard (which allow for
negative offsets):

* by appending the letter `Z` for UTC (e.g. "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ"), or
* by appending the complete "hours:minutes" positive or negative time
  offsets from UTC (e.g. "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm+03:00").

For more details see examples at
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[Wikipedia page on ISO 8601]
and the publicly available RFC at
link:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339[RFC 3339].

Other representations from those specifications are not necessarily supported.

|===============================================================================

NOTE: When present, the value of `ups.start.auto` has an impact on
`shutdown.*` commands. For the sake of coherence, shutdown commands
will set `ups.start.auto` to the right value before issuing the command.
That is, `shutdown.stayoff` will first set `ups.start.auto` to `no`,
while `shutdown.return` will set it to `yes`.

NOTE: When possible, time-stamps and dates should be expressed as detailed
above in the Time and Date format chapter.

[NOTE]
.Input Voltage Hysteresis
======
The input voltage hysteresis concept refers to a specific behavior related
to how some UPS models can handle changes in input voltage.

When the UPS is running normally (powered by utility or generator), it
maintains a steady output voltage for your critical equipment.  But what
if the input voltage "wiggles" a bit due to fluctuations or other minor
disturbances?

Rapid switching between UPS protection modes (utility power to battery
and vice versa) can stress both the UPS and its connected devices.

So, some UPS models set up thresholds: If the input voltage drops below
a certain "Low" level, the UPS won't immediately switch to battery mode.
Instead, it waits until it is sure the voltage stays consistently low
for a bit. Similarly, if the input voltage rises above another threshold
(the "High" level), the UPS won't rush back to normal mode. It waits for
stability.

By introducing hysteresis, such an UPS avoids unnecessary toggling, ensuring
smoother transitions and better protection for your sensitive and expensive
gear.

Three-phase additions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The additions for three-phase measurements would produce a very long table
due to all the combinations that are possible, so these additions are
broken down to their base components.

Phase Count Determination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`input.phases` (3 for three-phase, absent or 1 for 1phase)

`output.phases` (as for `input.phases`)

DOMAINs
^^^^^^^

Any input or output is considered a valid DOMAIN.

* input (should really be called input.mains, but keep this for compat)
** input.bypass
** input.servicebypass

* output (should really be called output.load, but keep this for compat)
** output.bypass
** output.inverter
** output.servicebypass

Specification (SPEC)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Voltage, current, frequency, etc are considered to be a specification of
the measurement.

With this notation, the old 1phase naming scheme becomes DOMAIN.SPEC

Example: `input.current`

CONTEXT
^^^^^^^

When in three-phase mode, we need some way to specify the target for most
measurements in more detail. We call this the CONTEXT.

With this notation, the naming scheme becomes DOMAIN.CONTEXT.SPEC when
in three-phase mode.

Example: `input.L1.current`

Valid CONTEXTs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    L1-L2  \
    L2-L3   \
    L3-L1    for voltage measurements
    L1-N    /
    L2-N   /
    L3-N  /

    L1  \
    L2  for current and power measurements
    L3  /
    N  - for current measurement

Valid SPECs
^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: For cursory readers -- the following couple of tables lists just the
short `SPEC` component of the larger `DOMAIN.CONTEXT.SPEC` naming scheme
for phase-aware values, as discussed in other sections of this chapter just
above. These are NOT to be used verbatim as complete data-point names!

Valid with/without context (i.e. per phase or aggregated/averaged)

NOTE:
`battery.charger.status` replaces the historic flags `CHRG` and `DISCHRG`
that were exposed through `ups.status`.
The `battery.charger.status` can have one of the following values:

- `charging`: battery is charging,
- `discharging`: battery is discharging,
- `floating`: battery has completed its charge cycle,
   and waiting to go to resting mode,
- `resting`: the battery is fully charged, and not charging nor discharging.

NOTE: When possible, time-stamps and dates should be expressed as detailed
above in the Time and Date format chapter.

ambient: Conditions from external probe equipment

NOTE: *n* stands for the sensors index. A special case is "ambient.0" which is
equivalent to "ambient" (without index), and represents the default sensor of
the device.  This is not to be confused with the device embedded sensor, which
is published as 'ups.temperature'.  The most important data is "ambient.count",
used to iterate over the whole set of outlets.

outlet.group: groups of smart outlets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a refinement of the outlet collection, providing grouped
management for a set of outlets. The same principles and data than the
outlet collection apply to outlet.group, especially for the indexing 'n'
and "outlet.group.count".

Most of the data published for outlets also apply to outlet.group,
including: id, name (similar as outlet "desc"), color, status, current and
voltage (including status, alarm and thresholds). Other actions and settings
also apply ({delay,timer}.{shutdown,start})

Some specific data to outlet groups exists:
